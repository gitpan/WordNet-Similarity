NAME

    INSTALL - how to install WordNet::Similarity

SYNOPSIS

     perl Makefile.PL

     make

     make test

     make install

DESCRIPTION

  Prerequisites

    You need to have WordNet (version 1.7.1 or later, 2.0 preferred) and
    WordNet::QueryData (version 1.30 or later) installed.

    WordNet is available at http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/ and
    WordNet::QueryData is available from
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-QueryData/.

    You should set the WNHOME environment variable to the location where you
    have WordNet installed; see the WordNet::QueryData documentation for
    more information.

  Installing

    The usual way to install the package is to run the following commands:

     perl Makefile.PL

     make

     make test

     make install

    If you can't set the WNHOME environment variable, you can use the WNHOME
    option when running perl Makefile.PL.  For example,

     perl Makefile.PL --WNHOME=/usr/local/WordNet-2.0

    You will often need root access/superuser priviledges to run
    make install.  The module can also be installed locally.  To do a local
    install, you need to specify a PREFIX option when you run 'perl
    Makefile.PL'.  For example,

     perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/sid

    or

     perl Makefile.PL LIB=/home/sid/lib PREFIX=/home/sid

    will install Similarity into /home/sid.  The first method above will
    install the modules in /home/sid/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3 (assuming you
    are using version 5.8.3 of Perl; otherwise, the directory will be
    slightly different).  The second method will install the modules in
    /home/sid/lib.  In either case the executable scripts will be installed
    in /home/sid/bin and the man pages will be installed in home/sid/share.

    Warning: do not put a dash or hyphen in front of PREFIX or LIB.

    In your perl programs that you may write using the modules, you may need
    to add a line like so

     use lib '/home/sid/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3';

    if you used the first method or

     use lib '/home/sid/lib';

    if you used the second method.  By doing this, the installed modules are
    found by your program.  To run the similarity.pl program, you would need
    to do

     perl -I/home/sid/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3 similarity.pl

    or

     perl -I/home/sid/lib

    Of course, you could also add the 'use lib' line to the top of the
    program yourself, but you might not want to do that.  You will need to
    replace 5.8.3 with whatever version of Perl you are using.  

    As an alternative to using the -I option from the command line, you 
    can also set the value of the PERL5LIB environement variable to
    include that directory. For example, in a .cshrc file you could set
    this as follows:

    setenv PERL5LIB /home/sid/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3

    The effect of using -I or PERL5LIB is to add the specified directory 
    to the @INC array, which stores the list of directories that perl 
    searches for when looking for modules. You can check the value of @INC 
    by running the command "perl -V". 

    The preceeding instructions should be sufficient for standard and  
    slightly non-standard installations. However, if you need to modify  
    other makefile options you should look at the ExtUtils::MakeMaker
    documentation. Modifying other makefile options is not recommended
    unless you really, absolutely, and completely know what you're doing!

    NOTE: The information-content based measures (res, lin, jcn) are invoked
    using the default information content file generated during installation
    of the modules. If, however, the version of WordNet being used on your
    system has changed since that time, or for some reason the modules are
    unable to locate the default information content files, then alternate
    information content files can be specified only by using a configuration
    file corresponding to each of the modules. Format and creation of
    configuration files has been discussed in the documentation. Utilities
    to generate information content files have been provided in the package.

    NOTE: If one (or more) of the tests run by 'make test' fails, you will
    see a summary of the tests that failed, followed by a message of the
    form "make: *** [test_dynamic] Error Y"  where Y is a number between 1
    and 255 (inclusive).  If the number is less than 255, then it indicates
    how many test failed (if more than 254 tests failed, then 254 will still
    be shown).  If one or more tests died, then 255 will be shown.  For more
    details, see:

    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/lib/Test/Builder.pm#EXIT_CODES

  System Requirements

    1.  Perl version 5.6 or later.  This package has been written in Perl,
        which is freely available from www.perl.org. This package assumes
        that perl is installed in the directory /usr/local/bin.  If this is
        where perl is on your computer, then the support programs can be run
        directly at the command line as 'similarity.pl ...' or
        'semCorFreq.pl...', etc. However, if Perl is not installed at this
        location, you would need to explicitly invoke them as 'perl
        similarity.pl ... ' or 'perl freqCount.pl...', etc.

    2.  WordNet: All the measures are based on WordNet. WordNet must be
        installed on your system. WordNet is freely downloadable from
        http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/. WordNet version 2.0 was used
        during the development and testing of the package; however, it
        should work with other versions of WordNet as well. The
        WordNet::QueryData Perl module is used to access WordNet. This
        module requires that an environment variable 'WNHOME', containing
        the path to the WordNet files, be set up. For further details,
        please see the WordNet::QueryData documentation.

    3.  WordNet::QueryData: This is the Perl interface to WordNet written by
        Jason Rennie. QueryData should be accessible on the @INC path of
        Perl. (Can be freely downloaded from
        http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-QueryData/).  QueryData 1.31 was
        used during the development. Also we observed that that due to some
        major changes in QueryData from its previous versions, this software
        does not work with the earlier versions of QueryData. If you have an
        earlier version of QueryData (1.29 or earlier) you may need to
        upgrade QueryData.

    4.  Berkeley DB: To use the WordNet::Similarity::vector measure, you
        need to have Berkeley DB installed on your system. This can be
        freely downloaded from http://www.sleepycat.com.  The vector measure
        is still experimental.  If you don't want to use the vector measure,
        you needed not worry about installing Berkeley DB or the
        BerkeleyDB.pm module (see below).

    5.  BerkeleyDB.pm: You also need the Perl interface (BerkeleyDB.pm) be
        installed on the system. This package was tested with version 0.20
        of the BerkeleyDB Perl module and version 4.1 of the Berkeley DB
        database. The Perl module for BerkeleyDB can be obtained at CPAN:
        http://search.cpan.org/dist/BerkeleyDB.

  Optional Tests

    Running 'make install' after make will run a short series of tests. 
    These tests should not take more than a few minutes to run.  There is
    another series of more rigorous tests that may also be run; however,
    these tests can take quite some time to run (over an hour on some
    machines).  To run these tests, run 'make test_all'.

  Example

    The following procedure will work on most Linux systems.

     cd /tmp
     wget http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/2.0/WordNet-2.0.tar.gz
     wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/J/JR/JRENNIE/WordNet-QueryData-1.31.tar.gz
     wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/S/SI/SID/WordNet-Similarity-0.07.tar.gz

    Then unpack each one:

     tar -zxvf WordNet-2.0.tar.gz
     tar -zxvf WordNet-QueryData-1.31.tar.gz
     tar -zxvf WordNet-Similarity-0.07.tar.gz

    Install WordNet:

     cd WordNet-2.0

    Unfortunately, you have to manually edit the Makefile yourself, but you
    probably only need to make one change. Open the Makefile with your
    favorite text editor (emacs, for example):

     emacs Makefile

    Then find the section that looks like this:

     PLATFORM = solaris
     #PLATFORM = irix
     #PLATFORM = linux

    Comment out the first line and uncomment the last line so that it looks
    like this:

     #PLATFORM = solaris
     #PLATFORM = irix
     PLATFORM = linux

    Exit the editor.

    Then just type:

     make BinWorld

    You will need root privileges to install.

     su
     make install
     exit

    Installing QueryData and Similarity is much easier:

     cd /tmp/WordNet-QueryData-1.31
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     su
     make install
     exit

     cd /tmp/WordNet-Similarity-0.07
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     su
     make install
     exit
