(Last modified -- 06/03/2003 -- Sid.)



06/03/2003 WordNet::Similarity ver 0.05

(1)  Added new measure of semantic relatedness, based on co-occurrence
     vectors of WordNet glosses.

(2)  Set up the package so that similarity.pl and the other perl 
     utilities get installed in "/usr/local/bin".

(3)  Complete rewrite of similarity.pl with cleaner code and added
     functionality:

     * Multiple parts of speech can be specified as car#nv (noun and verb
       forms of car) or cool#nar (noun, adjective and adverb forms of
       cool).

     * Word senses can now be specified as car#n#2, jump#v#2, etc.

     * Added functionality to similarity.pl to use a local install of
       WordNet::Similarity modules (in non-standard directories).

     * Output of similarity.pl now specifies the senses that represent the
       relatedness of two words.

(4)  Enforced limit on the cache size of modules.

(5)  Updated README to reflect the changes and to specify options for
     local installs of similarity.pl and the other utilities.

(6)  Fixed the perl docs (remove leading spaces).

(7)  Added mailing list address to documentation --
     (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wn-similarity).

(8)  Improved jcn and lin tracing ("bird-crane" problem obvious now).

(9)  Added new utility wordVectors.pl required for
     WordNet::Similarity::vector module.




05/02/2003 WordNet::Similarity ver 0.04

(1)  *Fixed* newline in traces.

(2)  *Fixed* blank line bug in brownFreq.pl.

(3)  *Fixed* "--offset" option bug in similarity.pl.

(4)  *Fixed* lin measure non-normalized scores... added zero infocontent
      handling in jcn and lin.

(5)  New utility rawtextFreq.pl, to generate information content files from
     plain text.

(6)  similarity.pl supports option to specify part-of-speech of input words
     while measuring relatedness.

(7)  Added option to specify (conifuration / information content) file in
     similarity.pl. 

(8)  Added Resnik counting option to the information content generation
     utilities. 

(9)  More documentation on information content utilities.

(10) Added Add-1 smoothing option to the information content generation
     utilities. 



03/10/2003 WordNet::Similarity ver 0.03

(1) Removed trace bug in hso.pm.

(2) Added test cases for all modules.



02/10/2003 WordNet::Similarity ver 0.01

(1) Created CPAN modules from distance ver 0.11.

(2) Modules are completely object oriented.

(3) Added Adapted Lesk semantic relatedness measure -- lesk.pm.

(4) Added simple edge counting semantic relatedness measure -- edge.pm.

(5) Added a random relatedness measure -- random.pm.

(6) jcn, res and lin measures now support verb hierarchies.

(7) Information content files can now be specified as parameters to the
    modules. 

(8) Tools provided to build information content files from various publicly
    available corpora.

(9) Various parameters now control the behavior of the modules. These
    parameters are passed to the modules through 'configuration files'.
