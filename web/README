Quick Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

Step 1
------

Unpack everything in the correct directory (you may have already done this
if you're reading this).  For example:

$ su
# mv similarity-cgi.tar.gz /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin
# cd /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin
# tar -zxvf similarity-cgi.tar.gz

Step 2
------

The following three files may need to be edited:
similarity.cgi
similarity_server.pl
wps.cgi

- similarity.cgi
   * change $remote_host to be the hostname or IP addr of the machine
     that similarty_server.pl.  If similarity_server.pl is running
     on the same machine as your web server, then 'localhost' or
     '127.0.0.1' will be sufficient

- similarity_server.pl
   * $BASEDIR should be changed to be a file writable by the UID under
     which the script will be running.  Usually $BASEDIR can be the
     absolute path of the directory in which this script resides.  E.g.,
     if the script is in /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/similarity, then this
     could be your $BASEDIR.

   * $wnlocation should be the location of the WordNet dictionary files.
     If you are using WordNet-2.0 on a Unix box, then
     /usr/local/WordNet-2.0/dict is probably what you want.

- wps.cgi
   * $remote_host should be the same as $remote_host for similarity.cgi

Step 3
------
Start similarity_server.pl running:

# similarity_server.pl &
